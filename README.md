# Game Logic
Apple Falling: Apples fall from the top at a constant rate. The player needs to catch them to score points.
Thorns Falling: Thorns also fall from the top. If the player collides with a thorn, they lose a life.
Score System: The score increases each time an apple is caught. Every 9 apples increase the fall speed of both apples and thorns.
Life System: The player starts with 3 lives. Losing all lives ends the game.
Game Over: When the player runs out of lives, the game will display a "Game Over" message.
# How to Play
Start the game by pressing the Space Bar. Apples and thorns will begin falling from the top.
Use the Left Arrow and Right Arrow keys to move the player and try to catch the falling apples.
If you catch an apple, your score increases. Be careful not to hit the thorns!
Every time you hit a thorn, you lose one life. If you lose all your lives, the game will end.
Press Space Bar again to restart the game after itâ€™s over.
